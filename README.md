# Overview
This repository contains the practical Jupyter Notebook for the short course "Large Language Models, Generative AI, and Urban Water Engineering," featured at the *3rd International Joint Conference on Water Distribution Systems Analysis & Computing and Control for the Water Industry (WDSA/CCWI)*, July 1 to July 4, 2024, Ferrara, Italy. Website: https://wdsa-ccwi2024.it/.

This Jupyter Notebook explains the basics of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground large language models using relevant content and the basic steps for the creation of a chatbot.

You can run it in Google Colab using a T4 GPU. The basic RAG applications in the tutorial will illustrate how to ground the LLM generation with knowledge from [USEPA WNTR](https://github.com/USEPA/WNTR) documention and an online blog from DHI.
